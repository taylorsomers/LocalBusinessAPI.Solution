# Local Business API

  ### By [Taylor Somers](https://github.com/taylorsomers/)

## Description

  This program is a demonstration of user authentication with Identity in the context of a bakery application that uses many-to-many MySQL database relationships to allow users to access create, update, and delete functionality for Treats and Flavors only if they are signed in. Each Flavor may be associated with many Treats, and each Treat may be may be associated with many Flavors. Users will be able to view content whether or not they are signed in, but will only be able to create, update, or delete objects in the application *if* they are signed in. The essential features of C# and .NET development using databases are present and easily usable, and the use of authentication with Identity in the context of a many-to-many object-oriented application is demonstrated. The application was build using C#/.NET, CSHTML, and MySQL with Entity Framework according to an MVC standard.
